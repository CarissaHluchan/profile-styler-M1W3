        <p class="bio">I worked as an Ophthalmic Photographer and enjoyed the technical aspects of the job while
            learning how to use specialized equipment and microscopes. After ten years I had learned all that there
            was
            to learn in this position without room for advancement and decided I needed a change. I wanted a career
            that
            would challenge me and continue the learning process while allowing for growth. I learned about coding
            from
            my partner and friends. I saw they had continued opportunities for learning in their careers and wanted
            that
            for myself so I joined Turing to learn how to code.</p>
